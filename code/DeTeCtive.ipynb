I'm sure some do allow it, I'm sure some don't. I would imagine that it's more common to let them watch it, since the excitement of seeing themselves in a movie surely offsets being creeped out and having some nightmares, and since they're less likely to be scared anyway since they saw how the movie was made. Seeing a man get decapitated by a demon's axe is presumably less shocking when it reminds you of the day spent rigging up mannequins with fake blood.\\n\\nAs anecdotal evidence, Danny Lloyd, who starred in The Shining at 6 years old, didn't even know he was filming a horror movie at the time, and when he went to the premiere to see it put together for the first time he said he didn't find it scary because he knew how it was made, knew the actors, etc and so couldn't buy it as real or immersive. And on the X-Files DVD commentaries, they briefly discuss this, and share a story about a child actor who was so proud of their X-Files episode that they distributed VHS copies to school friends and got in trouble for upsetting them with the horror and violence.\",\n          \"Bathroom outlets are what are called GFCI breakers. These aren't just simple circuit breakers like in your electrical panel that protect you from too much current. GFCI protect you from being electrocuted. How?\\n\\nWell, in the US most plugs have 3 prongs - hot, neutral, and ground. Ignore the ground for now. Any electrical component works* by sending electricity (called current) down the hot wire, through the thing you're using, and it returns back through the neutral wire, creating a *circuit*. If everything works correctly, the amount of current going *into* the device on the hot wire is the same as the amount going *out* of the device and back through the neutral. \\n\\nIn a situation where you drop a hair dryer into a tub or something like that, the current tries to follow a new path - usually from the hot wire, through the dryer, through the water, through *you*, and then to ground through your plumbing. Now, there is an imbalance - the amount of current coming out of the hot wire is now much larger than the current going back in through the neutral. A GFCI breaker detects this imbalance and turns the circuit off (it \\\"trips\\\"). \\n\\nAll GFCI breakers have a test feature that you're supposed to use (but no one does) where it tests to see that the breaker trips if there is a current imbalance. That's the \\\"test\\\" button. The \\\"reset\\\" resets the break to work again. \\n\\n^* *Yes, I know it's AC and current doesn't actually flow like down one wire and back another like in a DC circuit. For the sake of ELI5 let's pretend it does.*\",\n          \"The politically incorrect, but convenient for this discussion, term for the appearance is 'mongoloid' which was coined because down syndrome sufferers were thought to look like Mongols. A Victorian term for the disorder was 'mongoloid idiocy.' This appearance is one of the defining symptoms of Down syndrome so it is all suffers rather than some that it applies to, but it may be more noticeable in some individuals than others. \\n\\nThe explanation, in extremely basic terms (you'll probably need to consult r/askscience for a full explanation) \\n\\nDown syndrome is also known as 'trisomy 21'. Short for 'three copies of  chromosome 21 ' you're meant to have two copies of each chromosome (22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes) However, down syndrome occurs when two copies of '21' are inherited from the mother and one copy from the father. Instead of the usual one from each parent.\\n\\nNormally, by having two copies of each chromosome you increase your chances of being genetically healthy as an error in one can be covered for if it's pair is intact. This is why men get more genetic disorders, because their sex chromosomes are XY compared with women's XX, and so as they only have one X if they inherit a dodgy gene on that chromosome from their mum they haven't got a spare to correct for it. \\n\\nNow, with trisomy 21. The problem is too many cooks spoiling the broth, the correct genes may be there, but they are *over expressed* because there's 3 copies instead of 2. That's a massive oversimplification as genes affect the expression of other genes on other chromosomes and this is where it gets to r/askscience territory..\\n\\nThere's still a lot of research being done in to how exactly this extra chromosome effects over all genetic health, but the candidate for the 'mongoloid' appearance is a gene called ETS2 whose over expression may cause the skull to grow abnormally. \\n\\nTLDR: \\n\\nThey have an extra chromsome. It has a gene called ETS2 too many copies of this gene cause skull to grow abnormally. \\n\\nNB a small percentage of sufferers don't have the extra chromosome, instead extra genes from parts of an extra chromosome 21 are inherited from the mother  and attach (are translocated) to chromosome 14  \\n\\nNB ALSO:  this is a small part of a much longer and more complicated story - ETS2 is used here as an illustrative example, it is not the whole cause.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n
