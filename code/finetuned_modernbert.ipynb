Odysseus's son, Telemachus, burdened by the looming shadow of his father and the men who seek to marry his mother, travels to Pylos to perhaps find help from his father's friend, Nestor. In his journey, Telemachus meets Helen, the former queen of Sparta and cause of the Trojan War. She tells him of his father's journey home from the war and the men he encountered on his journey. In Ithaca, Penelope struggles to run her father's kingdom while fighting off the suitors who seek to marry her to claim her lands for themselves. She is aided by Theoclymenus, an old family friend who senses an impending storm. The story is related in the first person by a bard who is compelled by the Muses to tell the story of the fall of Troy and the wanderings of Odysseus.\n",
